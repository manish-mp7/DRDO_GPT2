The following code generates a bag or words analysis for vectorizing 
15 different abstracts of research papers. Furthermore it uses these 
bag or words to generate a summary using the GPT-2 tool. Below are 
the steps to be followed for the same.

1. Configure your laptop with the versions of python, GPT-2, numpy,
tensorflow and other libraries in the code.

2. Run the initial part of the code and generate the bag of word 
vector for the text of your choice. 

3. Word2count key word will have the desired BOW vector.

4. Clone the github repo of the GPT-2 model into your laptop using
git clone command.

5. Set up GPT-2 on the system with the right types of tensorflow
version and run the pip install requirements command.

6. src/interactive_conditional_samples.py will run a console for 
writing paragraphs and sentences which can be tried out.

7.Build a summirization transformer in the gpt-2 module to start 
using the transformer.

8. Finally use the keywords to generate summarizartions of the 
abstracts.
